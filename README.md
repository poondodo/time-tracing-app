This is a single page web application created by Chunxian Pan.
The motive to design this app is that I would like a tool to trace what I have done for a day. Since I always feel like "What?!! I have done nothing today but it is midnight now!"
So I suppose if I try to trace what I did in a day, it may help me control my life.

To use this app, you need to login first. But be sure not to use "dog" as a username.
I have input some synthetic data in it, and it shows how the content will display. Ofcourse you can delete them.
The only thing you need to do is to select type and duration of what you have done and see the change of records.
